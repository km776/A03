## Tutorial - Part 1
Hello there! If you're reading this, I bet you're itching to get your hands messy and delve into the world of computer programming...or you're currently grading my assignment. In that case, hey there, professor! You did say you were behind on grading, though...

#### _Note: I am going to assume you have a computer that runs Windows._

To get started with the magic of programming, we are first going to download an IDE called Webstorm. IDE stands for 'Integrated Development Environment', or in simpler terms, a place where programmers write and develop their applications/code. Visual Studio Code is a more popular example.

Because we are broke students who will definitely not pay for the subscription of Webstorm, we're going to use their free individual educational licenses. Just fill in the application [here](https://www.jetbrains.com/shop/eform/students) and make sure you apply using the 'Official document' tab of the application - then, use your NJIT email and send a picture of your Student ID. After a day or two, you should get a confirmation email of your newly available license!

I'll wait.

Just kidding, you can do something else in the meantime - download Git! (And make a GitHub account!)

Head over to this [link](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to open up the download page to install Git. Now, you might be asking:

#### _"Hey, what's the purpose of Git?"_
<sup><sub>(or you might not be asking, in which case, too bad.)</sub></sup>

  **Git** is software that helps manage version control, or track changes. It's local, which means it only runs on your system, and tracks changes in any set of files. 

  In Git, you can make a **repository**, which allows you to save versions of your code. It acts as virtual storage for your code - repositories can log history, making it very good for a detailed changelog. (You can make repositories in GitHub, too.)

#### _"So what's the difference between Git and GitHub?"_

  Great question! **GitHub** is as the name suggests, a "hub" (community) for many little "git(s)"<sup><sub>(not sure if that's the correct term.)</sub></sup>. It's hosted on the web, which makes it a service, not software. It helps programmers collaborate despite distance, because it's all based in the cloud.

  Simply put, it's a treasure chest for all of your treasures (repositories, or 'repos' for short). Just as there are many different treasure chests out there, there are different web services that function similarly to GitHub, though this is the most popular service.
  
Now, I'm assuming you've downloaded Git. Great! Let's move onto Github. Click [here](https://github.com/signup?ref_cta=Sign+up&ref_loc=header+logged+out&ref_page=%2Fpricing&source=header) to be navigated to GitHub's signup page. Use your UCID and school email to get a 'PRO' subscription for free. So far, I'm not exactly sure what it does besides provide a shiny purple label on your profile but hey, it's bound to be better. 

#### _Connecting Git + GitHub with Webstorm_

If you've gotten this far, I'm assuming you have installed Webstorm and Git, as well as signed up for a GitHub account.

If not, I can wait. I've got better assignments to do in my spare time anyway.

Oh, you're done? That was fast. Back in _my_ day,...





## Glossary - Part 2 
(Words listed in order of appearance)

* Git: Version control software
* Repository: Virtual storage for code
* GitHub: A web service that allows for cross-platform collaboration due to hosting repositories on its site

--
Document your knowledge of Git, WebStorm, and GitHub by creating a step by step tutorial in your readme file. 
You need to make a tutorial that you could give to someone else that describes the process of how to use Git+Github. 
You outside resources as well as my PowerPoint presentations. Cite all references and put the Reference list at the end of the document.

You must include definitions for the following terms in a separate list aside from your directions
Add a step by step set of directions. Include URLs of any downloaded software. 

 

Part 2: Glossary to include these terms in a bulleted list.

Bold each of the Glossary words as you use them.  Bold ONLY the glossary word.

Branch
Clone
Commit
Fetch
Merge
Merge Conflict
Push
Pull
Remote

Your commits should have clear messages like:


Task: Create Repository

Feature:  added workflow for using github

Fix:  changed readme.md for definition of terms
